# Video-Classification

In this project, an innovative approach for video classification and captioning is proposed by extracting keyframes from the videos. Densenet 201 is used to classify the videos.
Instead of extracting every frame of the video we have created our own algorithm to identify the most significant frame which is used as an input to the model. Our approach significantly reduces the time taken to train the model and also improves the performance of the model by reducing noise.
